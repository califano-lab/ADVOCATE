## This is a short manual on how to run ADVOCATE to
## reproduce the data in the ADVOCATE manuscript

## Step 0. 
## Install the R software as described here: "https://www.r-project.org"

## Step 1. Install ADVOCATE package 
## Download the distribution file ("ADVOCATE_SOFTWARE 2.zip") 
## into a directory of choice (e.g., your home directory "~/")
## unzip the file. This should create a sub-directory "ADVOCATE_SOFTWARE"

## open a terminal window and set the directory to the one where
## the ADVOCATE files have been expanded, e.g., by executing the line:

cd ~/ADVOCATE_SOFTWARE

## execute the following command from the terminal 

R CMD INSTALL ADVOCATE_0.1.0.tar.gz

## Step 2. Install dependencies 
## open R and copy following lines into R console 
## required R packages 

install.packages("foreach")
install.packages("doMC")
install.packages('iterators')
install.packages('parallel')
install.packages('mclust')
install.packages('scales')

## Step 3. Run example files 
## Make sure the data files are in current directory
## COPY following line into terminal 
## This will take ~10mins to finish 
## Go to the ADVOCATE directory, e.g., by running the following command
 
cd ~/ADVOCATE_SOFTWARE 

## Run the examples by executing the following command:

Rscript ADV_example.R 

## uses raw LCM samples from epi and stroma to calculate 
## DEG and the weight metric for ADVOCATE model training.
